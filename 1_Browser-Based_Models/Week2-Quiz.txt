Q1. What is the correct syntax for the first layer in a convolutional neural network that takes an MNIST (28x28 monochrome) input? 
Sol. model.add(tf.layers.conv2d({inputShape: [28, 28, 1], kernelSize: 3, filters: 8, activation: 'relu'})); 

Q2. What is the correct syntax for adding a maxPooling2D layer to a Convolutional neural network in JavaScript?
Sol. model.add(tf.layers.maxPooling2d({poolSize: [2, 2]})); 

Q3. What is the correct syntax for compiling a model with an optimizer, loss function and metrics?
Sol. model.compile({  optimizer: tf.train.adam(), loss: 'categoricalCrossentropy', metrics: ['accuracy']});

Q4. How do you correctly pass a set of validation data called textXs and testYs to the model.fit method in JavaScript?
Sol. Use validationData: [testXs, testYs] in the list of parameters sent as the third parameter to model.fit

Q5. How do you get the built in callbacks visualizer with TensorFlow.js?
Sol. Include the tfjs-vis script, set a callback in model.fit, and set it to a const that called show.fitCallbacks() on the tfvis object

Q6. If you want to see loss, validation loss, accuracy and validation accuracy on each epoch while training, how do you do this?
Sol. Create a list containing text values with the names of the analytics you want to capture, i.e. [‘loss’, ‘val_loss’, ‘acc’, ‘val_acc’] and pass it to fitCallbacks() as a parameter

Q7. When using a dataset like MNIST or FashionMNIST, why is it advisable to use a sprite sheet containing all the images?
Sol. It prevents excessive multiple HTTP calls to download the data

Q8. What is the role of tf.tidy() in TensorFlow.js?
Sol. When it is executed, it cleans up all intermediate tensors allocated by a function except those returned by the function
