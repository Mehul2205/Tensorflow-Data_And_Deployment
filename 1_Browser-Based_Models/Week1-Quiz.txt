Q2. How does TensorFlow.js use GPU acceleration in the browser?
Sol. You access GPU using WebGL in the browser

Q3. How can you use a TPU with TensorFlow.js?
Sol. You can use Node.js on GCP and access TPU instances

Q4. Which of the following lines of code will correctly add a single dense layer containing a single neuron that takes a numeric input to a model using JavaScript?
Sol. model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));

Q5. When creating data to input to a model using Python you could use a numpy array. How would you do it in JavaScript?
Sol. Use a tensor2d containing the data and the shape of the data

Q6. If I train a model to detect a linear relationship (i.e. Y=2X-1), what line of code would output a prediction from that model for Y where X=10?
Sol. alert(model.predict(tf.tensor2d([10], [1,1])));
